# SuperMario-Monopoly
 
A gift for my kids.

They love both Super Mario and Monopoly, so I decided to make a DIY Monopoly game with super mario theme for them.

The kids designed all the contents, and save them in "Monopoly_template.xls", dad found some pictures for the cards.
I wrote the script to read data from "Monopoly_template.xls" and generate a series of cards with the exactly same format as the standard version of Monopoly so that we can reuse the other game accessories to play the game.

The cards are in PDF format. Dad printed them out, cut on the dotted lines and laminated. Then, it is ready to play.
